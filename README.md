# Web-Design-Challenge

The purpose of this project is to create a visualization dashboard website using visualizations created for the Weather/Vacation (https://github.com/lakshmi-bhimavarapu/python-api-challenge) project.

The dashboard can be viewed at:  https://github.com/lakshmi-bhimavarapu/Web-Design-Challenge

The website consist of seven pages as follows:

A landing page that contains the following elements:

An explanation of the project.

A link to each visualization page. For these, a sidebar should contain a preview image of each visualization. Clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.

Four visualization pages, stored in the visualizations folder, each with the following elements:

  A descriptive title and a heading tag.

The visualization for the selected comparison (latitude vs. max temperature, latitude vs. humidity, latitude vs. cloudiness, or latitude vs. wind speed). The images that these pages display should be stored in the assets/images folder.

  A paragraph describing the visualization and its significance.

A comparisons page that does the following:

  Contains all the visualizations on the same page so that people can easily compare them.

A data page that displays a responsive table containing the data that the visualizations use, as follows:
  The data must come from either exporting or converting the CSV file to HTML. 
 
The website has at the top of every page a navigation menu that:

Has the name of the site on the left which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
Contains a dropdown on the right of the navbar named Plots which provides links to each individual visualization page.
Provides two more links on the right: Comparisons which links to the comparisons page, and Data which links to the data page.
